Project Overview
YouTube Live Data Analytics is a comprehensive data analysis project that gathers, processes, and visualizes live data from YouTube to provide actionable insights into video performance metrics. This project demonstrates skills in API integration, data transformation, KPI analysis, and dashboard creation.

Key Features
Data Collection: Integration with YouTube's API to fetch real-time data.
Data Processing: Extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes using Python and Pandas.
KPI Analysis: Calculation of key performance indicators like:
Average watch duration
Number of likes, dislikes, and comments
Viewer engagement metrics
Data Visualization: Interactive charts and graphs using libraries like Matplotlib, Plotly, and Streamlit.
Dashboard: A user-friendly interface for tracking video performance in real-time.
